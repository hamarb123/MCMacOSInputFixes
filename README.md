Fixes control + tab and control + escape not being detected

Specific fixes:
- Correctly detects left click while control is pressed
- Make trackpad scrolling not scroll a ridiculous number of items at once
- It also fixes momentum scrolling (which changes the number of scroll events based on how quickly you did it, even by like x5-10, meaning you couldn't easily scroll to the correct item)
- On the trackpad it also only considers scrolling while fingers are on the trackpad (and the same for any fancy mice that support the relevant api e.g. probably apple's fancy mice/trackpad thing)
- It also fixes (almost perfectly) scrolling being broken when shift is down, this issue only affects mice that use older input APIs and doesn't change anything on the trackpad. It converts scrolling with shift down which shows as horizontal scrolling to the correct vertical scroll, the only issue when you actually scroll horizontally and hold shift, this will show as vertical scrolling (which is imo acceptable since very few people would be scrolling Minecraft items with horizantal scrolling on a non-apple input device compared to people scrolling vertical on any mice; and they could, if they need, use vertical scrolling instead which would be completely consistent - and this also isn't an issue if the Minecraft item scroll direction for + vertical scrolling is treated the same as + horizontal scrolling). TL;DR - this project will work properly for both vertical and horizontal scrolling including when pressing shift.
- When dropping an item, Minecraft checks for command + the key, since the default key is Q, this doesn't make sense, so this mod allows both control + key and command + key to work
- Fixes control + tab and control + escape not being detected

Menu Options (under Mouse Settings Screen):
- Option for trackpad scrolling sensitivity (macOS only)
- Option to enable momentum scrolling on hotbar (macOS only)
- Option to disable workaround for smooth scrolling in interfaces (macOS only)
- Option to reverse scrolling of the whole game
- Option to reverse scrolling of the hotbar
- Option to disable the fix for the ctrl + left click becomes right click bug (macOS only)

On platforms other than macOS, the mod does nothing (except the aformentioned menu options), so it can be safely included in any modpack.

## Running

This mod requires Fabric, Fabric loader 0.14.22+, and Minecraft 1.14+. I've only really tested it properly on the major releases, so ymmv if you run it on snapshots, but it probably works.

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.

## Building

To build this, you also need to build the native file before building the mod itself any time you modify it. This can only be done on macOS and requires Apple's XCode (or command line-tools) to be installed on the machine. To build the native library, simply run `make clean && make` in the `src/main/native` directory. This should work on both intel and arm machines, but I've only tested in on an intel machine. The resulting binary supports both x64 and arm64, so no need to worry about the architecture of the native.

## Testing

If you make changes, you should test everything works properly on the following versions at least:
- 1.14
- 1.15
- 1.16
- 1.16.2
- 1.17
- 1.18
- 1.19
- 1.19.3
- 1.20
- 1.21
- 1.21.2
- 1.21.5

## Mixin Naming Scheme

Some mixins are in a folder called `gui`, these mixins are to do with the option menu interface, or only used by other option menu interface code. Some mixins have a number at the end of their name, these mixins are conditionally loaded based on whether certain classes are available at runtime. The numbering is currently as follows (note some of the classes may have different names in different intermediary mappings, consult the latest applicable version if you can't find the class):
1. The `SimpleOption` class is available (1.19+)
2. The `Option` class is available (1.14-1.18.x)
3. The `CyclingButtonWidget` class is available (1.17+)
4. Both the `Option` and `CyclingButtonWidget` classes are available (1.17-1.18.x)
5. The `GameOptionsScreen.getHoveredButtonTooltip(ButtonListWidget, int, int)` function exists (1.16.2-1.19.2)
6. The `GameOptionsScreen.getHoveredButtonTooltip(ButtonListWidget, int, int)` function doesn't exist, the `Screen.renderTooltip(MatrixStack, List, int, int)` function exists, and the `Option` class exists (1.16-1.16.1)
7. Either 5 or 6 (1.16-1.19.2)
8. 1 and doesn't have `MouseOptionsScreen.init()` (1.21+)
9. 1 and has `MouseOptionsScreen.init()` (1.19-1.20.x)
10. Has `PlayerInventory.scrollInHotbar(double)` (1.14-1.21.1)
11. Doesn't have `PlayerInventory.scrollInHotbar(double)` (1.21.2+)
